## Add your national language (Prime)

So currently Skip Intro, Skip Recap, Next episode skip works for 22 languages supported by prime.
But skip Ads in only supported in a few languages, to enable that in your language, I would need your help in translation of the word `Skip` to your national language.

Please have a look at the file `src/utils/i18n.js`, and add the respective value against keyword `skip_ads` in `i18nMap`.

Please test it in your system, raise a PR and tag me for review. Ping me if you have any doubts.

The data is totally anonymous, you can also verify the same in the network tab.
